However, having already helped Atletico Madrid to win the Europa League in 2009/10 and the UEFA Super Cup thereafter, he was more than up to the task. His first season at United saw him unfairly scrutinised by sections of the media at every turn, but he adapted to the English game to show his true colours. \n" + "\n" + "The Madrid-born shot-stopper’s fan-favourite status at Old Trafford has been emphasised by him claiming the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award on four occasions, more than any other player in United's history. Meanwhile, he has also collected the club’s Player’s Player of the Year award three times, showing the high regard his team-mates hold him in. \n" + "\n" + "A mainstay of the Reds’ side, and occasional captain, his efforts between the posts have earned him respect from his peers as well, illustrated by the fact he has appeared in the PFA Team of the Year five times. In 2017/18, De Gea also became the first Reds keeper to win the Golden Gloves award, for keeping the most clean sheets in the Premier League, in nine years. \n" + "\n" + "The following campaign, was his first as an ever-present in the division and contained some real highs, such as a remarkable performance in a win at Tottenham and an astounding stop against Young Boys in the Champions League. David’s form towards the end of the campaign, mirroring that of the team in general, did slip below his usual standard but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer backed his no.1 and rightly praised his character and unquestioned ability.\n" + "\n" + "A challenge for the Spain jersey was brought by Chelsea’s Kepa Arrizabalaga, and, later, Unai Simon of Athletic Club.\n" + "\n" + "De Gea signed a new long-term contract in September 2020, tying him to the club until at least June 2023, but the 2019/20 season was an indifferent one for the Madrileno. Despite plenty of typically miraculous saves –  an astounding double effort at Sheffield United, and a superb performance in the Carabao Cup win against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium – there were also some uncharacteristic lapses in concentration.\n" + "\n" + "But David maintained his place in the United goal for the start of 2020/21, and, although there were plenty of outings for Dean Henderson, he made 28 appearances in total. Unfortunately, the last of these was a painful experience as his penalty was saved in the shoot-out against Villarreal in the Europa League final, leading to an 11-10 loss, after the 1-1 draw in Gdansk.\n" + "\n" + "Determined to bounce back, he was soon reaching peak form again once 2021/22 got under way. Three successive Player of the Month awards at the club were testament to his quality and consistency, and this was followed by being named the Premier League Player of the Month for January. He was the first keeper since Southampton's Fraser Forster in 2016 to earn the trophy.\n" + "\n" + "De Gea remained a consistent performer for the rest of the season, culminating in the Spaniard being voted United's Player's Player of the Year by his team-mates, winning the award for a record fourth time.",

He was part of the Three Lions' squad for the European Championship and was again involved in the Nations League finals of 2019 – to date he is the proud owner of three senior international caps.\n" + "\n" + "His most recent call-up came in November 2019, by which time he had left Burnley to join Aston Villa. Again he impressed at Premier League level, before suffering a serious cruciate knee ligament injury on New Year's Day at his former home ground, Turf Moor.\n" + "\n" + "With Heaton unavailable, Villa were moved to bring in ex-Arsenal stopper Emiliano Martinez, who was able to claim the no.1 jersey in Heaton's absence. With first-team opportunities limited, United pounced to snap the former Red up when his Villa contract came to an end in the summer of 2021.\n" + "\n" + "At just 35, a relatively modest age for a goalkeeper (Edwin van der Sar was 34 when he joined the Reds in 2005, for example), Heaton has his eyes set \"firmly\" on trying to get into the team.\n" + "\n" + "United have reacquired a prodigal son, but one who returns to the club as a strong, organised leader, with a wealth of experience behind him.\n" + "\n" + "Heaton made his first-team debut in December 2021, in a Champions League group-stage game against Young Boys of Bern. He replaced Dean Henderson in the 68th minute, ending a 20-year wait for a senior Manchester United appearance.\n" + "\n" + "The goalkeeper continued to battle with Henderson and David de Gea for the remainder of the season, as part of our talented goalkeeper's union.",

It helped provide added impetus to his club career as he forced his way into the senior Benfica side and enjoyed experience in the domestic top flight and Champions League.\n" + "\n" + "Patience has been important for the Scandinavian, who burst into Vasteras' first team when only 16 years old. He helped his local side gain promotion but left when Benfica came calling in 2012. The Lisbon giants had seen his potential in Sweden's Under-16s and Under-17s and made their move.\n" + "\n" + "Still only 17, Lindelof understandably had to wait for an opportunity and cut his teeth with the B team, before emerging as one of Europe’s most exciting young defenders with the senior side.\n" + "\n" + "Winning trophies became something of a habit during his time in Portugal, as he collected three league titles, two Portuguese Cups, one League Cup and one Super Cup. This being in addition to his European Under-21 Championship medal, of course.\n" + "\n" + "In 2017, the composed centre-back signed a four-year deal at United, with the option of a further year. The defender ended his maiden campaign in England with 29 appearances and a number of impressive performances towards the end of the season, including a Man-of-the-Match display against Arsenal in April.\n" + "\n" + "After reaching the quarter-finals of the 2018 World Cup with Sweden, he continued his development in the 2018/19 season, maintaining a consistent level of form that endeared him to the Old Trafford faithful. Lindelof's fine performances saw him named the club's Player of the Month for November - when he was also named Sweden's Player of the Year at an awards ceremony in Stockholm. \n" + "\n" + "Two months later, he scored his first goal in a red shirt, netting a late equaliser against Burnley. A groin injury hampered his progress in the final weeks of the season, but Victor still emerged as one of the biggest plusses of the campaign. He came a close second, behind Luke Shaw, in the votes for the Players' Player of the Year and Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year awards respectively. \n" + "\n" + "In the 2019/20 campaign, the Swede featured in 35 Premier League matches, forming a solid partnership with United skipper Harry Maguire in a season where United finished third in the table and thereby qualified for the Champions League. In December 2019, he scored his second goal for the club in a 2-2 draw with Aston Villa at Old Trafford and he was a regular presence the following season, as the Reds came second and made it to the Europa League final.\n" + "\n" + "Lindelof's stature grew even further in the 2021/22 season, as became a trusted partner for both Harry Maguire and Raphael Varane. The Swede regularly demonstrated his composure on the ball and coupled that with stern defensive resilience to become a valuable asset for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and interim manager Ralf Rangnick.\n" + "\n" + "Our Swedish centre-back made 35 appearances in all competitions in 2021/22, producing impressive performances away from home against the likes of Villareal and Spurs.

However, he returned to the side to help United win the Premier League title and claim his first trophy with the club.\n" + "\n" + "A regular during the 2013/14 campaign, he earned a place in England’s 2014 World Cup squad and he impressed at centre-back during 2014/15 despite his appearances being further restricted by injuries. \n" + "\n" + "The signing of a new long-term contract in June 2015 emphasised his importance to the United cause and he was part of the FA Cup-winning squad against Crystal Palace in May 2016. \n" + "\n" + "Injury once again disrupted the start of his first campaign under Jose Mourinho in 2016/17 but he still helped make it a memorable season as United claimed the League Cup and Europa League trophies.\n" + "\n" + "The centre-back enjoyed one of his best campaigns in a red shirt in 2017/18 and was one of the first names on the team sheet.

            "Harry Maguire has risen through the leagues to establish himself as one of the most reliable centre-backs in the game.\n" + "\n" + "However, his route to the top has not always been an easy one. \n" + "\n" + "The Sheffield-born star came through the youth system at his hometown club Sheffield United. A resilient and tough-tackling defender, Maguire progressed into the first team at the age of 18 and made his debut for the Blades against Cardiff City in April 2011.\n" + "\n" + "The early signs of Harry’s quality were clear to see. Despite being introduced as a half-time substitute in that Championship clash with the Bluebirds, the then-teenager was named Man of the Match.\n" + "\n" + "Sadly, that campaign ended in relegation for Sheffield United, yet Maguire, who featured five times in his first season, had impressed the locals at Bramall Lane. He would go on to spend three more years with the Yorkshire outfit and make 166 appearances for the Blades, while netting on 12 occasions.\n" + "\n" + "A host of top-tier sides had been monitoring Maguire’s development, but it was one of United's finest centre-backs of all time who ultimately managed to prize Harry from his boyhood club. However, after signing the youngster at Hull City, Steve Bruce was wary of blooding him into the side, ahead of experienced defenders such as former Red James Chester, Curtis Davies and Michael Dawson.\n" + "\n" + "After playing just a handful of games in the first half of the 2014/15 campaign, Maguire was sent on loan to struggling Wigan Athletic, who, like Hull, were relegated that season. But with Maguire at the heart of defence, the Tigers instantly returned to the Premier League in the following campaign.\n" + "\n" + "Aged 23 at the time, Harry was five years into his professional career and had already faced his fair share of adversity. While Hull again failed to beat the drop in 2016/17, Maguire’s individual performances caught the eye. In fact, so impressive were Harry's displays, he was voted the club’s Player of the Year, earned a move to Leicester and was called up to Gareth Southgate’s England squad.\n" + "\n" + "Always a colossal presence at the back, it was during his time with Leicester that Maguire developed the passing side to his game, which he is now so eulogised for among Premier League aficionados. In two years at the Foxes, Harry established himself as one of the division’s standout centre-backs, while also becoming a cornerstone of England’s recent World Cup and Nations League campaigns.\n" + "\n" + "He has also proved effective at the other end of the pitch and famously headed home the Three Lions’ opener against Sweden in the 2018 World Cup quarter-final, while scoring five goals for the Foxes. Maguire even netted an injury-time equaliser against United in December 2017 to earn his former employers a 2-2 draw.\n" + "\n" + "Harry’s rise through the divisions, while also overcoming the occasional moment of hardship, has seen him mature into an all-round leader - one the world’s top sides simply could not overlook. \n" + "\n" + "But it was the allure of playing for a club of such stature and pedigree that ultimately convinced Harry to swap the East Midlands for Old Trafford, completing his move to the Reds on 5 August 2019.\n" + "\n" + "It didn't take long for Maguire to make an impact on the dressing room and, after wearing the captain's armband on a handful of occasions, he was appointed as United's new permanent skipper on 17 January 2020 following Ashley Young's departure to Inter Milan. Nine days later, Harry led by example in the Emirates FA Cup win over Tranmere Rovers as his first goal for the club triggered an eventual 6-0 triumph.\n" + "\n" + "The skipper then scored an important header at Stamford Bridge as United beat Chelsea in a crucial game for the Champions League spots. He also got on the scoresheet in the FA Cup as Norwich were beaten late at Carrow Road as United reached the semi-final of the tournament. \n" + "\n" + "Maguire remained a mainstay in the United defence throughout the season which ended with a third-place finish and Champions League qualification. Both were secured with a 2-0 win at his former home ground, the King Power Stadium, on the last day of the 2019/20 campaign. \n" + "\n" + "There was further improvement the following term, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side finishing second, but Maguire missed the end of the season - and the Europa League final - with injury.\n" + "\n" + "Despite suffering some niggling injuries throughout the season, Maguire racked up 37 appearances for United in 2021/22. Trusted by Solskjaer - and then interim manager Ralf Rangnick - Harry made 35 starts in what ended up being a disappointing season for the Reds as we finished sixth in the Premier League.\n" + "\n" + "Maguire contributed to some of our most crucial victories of the season, such as his strong defensive display in our 1-0 win over West Ham. The skipper also got on the scoresheet twice in 2021/22, slotting home a Champions League goal against Atalanta and powering in a header away to Leeds in the Premier League.",

Born in April 1993, he signed his first professional contract at boyhood club Lens just after turning 17, on the back of an impressive season playing with older team-mates at Under-19 level.\n" + "\n" + "Lens boss Jean-Guy Wallemme was so convinced by his young charge’s talent that, when faced with a defensive injury crisis, he threw the tall and composed Varane in as a starter for a November 2010 clash with Montpellier.\n" + "\n" + "A rare clean sheet for the Ligue 1 strugglers followed and, even though that season would end in relegation, Europe’s top clubs had been alerted to the potential of the teenager, who made 23 top-flight appearances and even showed his leadership capabilities when captaining the side in their closing game.\n" + "\n" + "Sir Alex Ferguson, looking for a long-term replacement for Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, was very interested and, according to his book, our legendary boss personally got involved in the negotiations, only for Real Madrid and new sporting director Zinedine Zidane to step in.\n" + "\n" + "A thoughtful, studious figure – he supposedly asked Zidane to call him back when gauging his interest in the Madrid move, as he was revising for his economics exams – Varane joined the Bernabeu club in late June, starting a 10-year association in which he was, largely, a fulcrum in one of the Spanish club’s most storied sides.\n" + "\n" + "After being a bit-part player in the 2011/12 La Liga success, the Frenchman soon established himself as centre-back alongside Sergio Ramos, impressing in Europe to such an extent that, in 2013, he was named in Marca’s ‘best-ever Real Madrid foreign XI’, despite playing fewer than 50 games.\n" + "\n" + "Any accusations of those plaudits being premature were put to bed a year later, when Varane helped Los Blancos to the fabled ‘La Decima’ – a 10th Champions League triumph – as they dramatically beat city rivals Atletico Madrid in Lisbon.\n" + "\n" + "Aged 21, Varane virtually completed the set of major club trophies with Club World Cup success later that month, but there was more to come, especially after Zidane replaced Rafa Benitez in the Bernabeu hot seat in January 2016.\n" + "\n" + "Raphael was absent for the next Champions League triumph later that year through injury but was again a key member of the side as Real became the first club since Bayern Munich in the 1970s to win three consecutive European Cups, with further successes in 2017 and 2018.\n" + "\n" + "Zidane, who had also won La Liga with his former club side in 2017, announced his departure following that feat, culminating in a poor 2018/19 campaign, but returned to mastermind another title, with Varane the heartbeat of an experienced team alongside the likes of Ramos, Karim Benzema and Toni Kroos.\n" + "\n" + "Just over 10 years after the highly-rated teenager left France, Varane departs Madrid as one of Real’s most decorated overseas players, but he will also take his place alongside the likes of Laurent Blanc, Marcel Desailly and Lilian Thuram in the pantheon of top-class French defenders.\n" + "\n" + "A youth international at various levels, he made his full debut for Les Bleus in 2013 and went to the following year’s World Cup, where he was one of three shortlisted for the tournament’s Best Young Player award.\n" + "\n" + "The youngest player to captain France in 104 years, injury caused him to miss out on the run to the Euro 2016 final on home soil, but he more than made up for that two years later in Russia.\n" + "\n" + "Didier Deschamps’s men were crowned world champions, with Varane playing every minute of the tournament and scoring the key opening goal in the quarter-final victory over Uruguay and that ability to come good in the clutch moments – without ever stealing the headlines – has defined Raphael’s career.\n" + "\n" + "He caught the eye at Real especially with his performances in the latter stages of the Champions League, with Los Blancos making it to the final four in all but two of his seasons there. But Cristiano Ronaldo and Ramos were usually the main men, with Varane happy to quietly get on with it.\n" + "\n" + "“Tall and athletic, there’s a presence about Varane, an understated authority,” writes Spanish football expert Sid Lowe. “But not exactly the loudest in the dressing room, nor immediately charismatic or flamboyant, he doesn’t demand attention, on or off the pitch. He just plays: regularly for a decade at the most unforgiving place, remember.”\n" + "\n" + "Of course, Old Trafford isn’t exactly immune to the spotlight either. But few overseas arrivals have come better equipped to succeed than Varane, who really has seen and done it all.\n" + "\n" + "Unveiled on the pitch prior to United's 5-1 win over Leeds in August 2021, Varane made his Reds debut two weeks later at Molineux. Following his first United appearance, the Frenchman went on to star 29 times for the Reds in his debut season.\n" + "\n" + "Varane's first season was disrupted by injuries, forcing the centre-back to miss 16 matches in all competitions. However, when he was fit, the Frenchman oozed class.\n" + "\n" + "Varane also managed to notch his first goal for United in his debut season, volleying home from a corner in our comfortable 3-0 win over Brentford in May. After impressing in his first year at Old Trafford, supporters will be eager to see what the Frenchman can do next.",

He netted twice against Midtjylland when thrust into the spotlight in a Europa League tie and followed it up with a brace against Arsenal on his Premier League bow.\n" + "\n" + "The fleet-footed forward found the net on his first England appearance, within a couple of minutes of the 2-1 win over Australia at Sunderland’s Stadium of Light to become the youngest man to score on his Three Lions debut, beating Tommy Lawton’s 1938 record.\n" + "\n" + "A famous derby winner at Manchester City and crucial FA Cup replay goal on the way to winning the trophy under Louis van Gaal continued his sharp upward trajectory, which continued with representing his country at Euro 2016.

Indeed, Jose Mourinho continued to show faith in the youngster as he was constantly involved and bagged a memorable double in a 2-1 home victory against Liverpool in 2018.\n" + "\n" + "Becoming ever more important for club and country, he nervelessly fired home a penalty in the dramatic shoot-out win over Colombia at the World Cup finals and would later show similar steel to power the injury-time spot-kick past Gianluigi Buffon to knock Paris Saint-Germain out of the 2018/19 Champions League at the Parc des Princes.\n" + "\n" + "Such mental fortitude has quickly become part of Rashford’s make-up as he has shouldered a lot of responsibility in attack and ran tirelessly in games, defending from the front and displaying great energy. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer appears to relish helping to mentor the striker and is working on honing his finishing prowess as the Academy product develops his game even further.\n" + "\n" + "Following Romelu Lukaku's departure to Inter Milan, it was suggested he would need to improve his goal output and he delivered in the opening game of the 2019/20 season with a brace in the 4-0 defeat of Chelsea, maintaining his good record against other top-six sides. A landmark 50th strike for the Reds came in October, when he atoned for having a penalty saved by Tim Krul when expertly finishing Daniel James's through ball.\n" + "\n" + "The goals continued to flow for the homegrown product as he scooped the club's Player-of-the-Month award for November and December, and also the overall PFA Premier League prize for the last month of 2019. He marked his 200th appearance for the club with a double in a 4-0 victory over Norwich City in January.\n" + "\n" + "A stress fracture to his back ruled him out of action prior to the suspension of football during the COVID-19 pandemic, but Rashford used his time out to campaign against homelessness and child hunger in the United Kingdom – work for which he would go on to receive an MBE.\n" + "\n" + "While receiving wider acclaim for his actions off the pitch, Marcus continued to impress on it, scoring his first United hat-trick against RB Leipzig in the Champions League on the way to registering 21 goals in all competitions in 2020/21 – just one fewer than in the previous season.\n" + "\n" + "He captained the England senior side for the first time in a friendly with Romania before Euro 2020, scoring a penalty which brought him to 100 goals for club and country, at the still tender age of 23.\n" + "\n" + "Following the Euros, Rashford had surgery on an ongoing shoulder issue, which ruled the winger out for the beginning of the 2021/22 season. The attacker missed the first seven Premier League matches and returned to action with a goal off the bench away to Leicester in October 2021.\n" + "\n" + "Despite not hitting the heights of his previous seasons Rashford was regularly utilised by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and then by interim manager Ralf Rangnick, making 32 appearances in total across the season.

His play is fearless, skilful and expressive and he thrives when isolating defenders and taking them on, one-on-one.\n" + "\n" + "Born in London on 25 March 2000, Sancho grew up in Kennington, idolising Ronaldinho and playing cage football amid the capital's high-rise buildings. He joined Watford's youth set-up aged seven and moved into the club's partner school as a boarder four years later, thus avoiding the long travel time across from south London.\n" + "\n" + "Aged 14, Sancho left the capital and its surrounds, joining Manchester City where he excelled in the youth set-up. Regularly dominating games, it quickly became clear that Sancho was one of English football's most exciting young talents, a fact confirmed when he was named Player of the Tournament at the Under-17 European Championship in May 2017.\n" + "\n" + "In the summer of that year, Sancho left England before he'd made a single senior appearance, bravely moving abroad in search of first-team football, which he found at Borussia Dortmund after an £8m transfer to Germany.\n" + "\n" + "The London-born winger gradually settled into life in a new country and, despite immediately handing the 17-year-old the number seven shirt, Dortmund were initially cautious in their approach. Sancho made his Bundesliga debut as a late substitute on 21 October 2017, his first start the following January, and then truly ignited the spark with a goal – his first in the league – and two assists in a 4-0 win against Bayer Leverkusen in April 2018.\n" + "\n" + "From there, he kicked on in stunning fashion, with October 2018 being an outstanding month. Within the space of a few weeks, Sancho made his England debut, became the first player born in the 2000s to score in the UEFA Champions League when he struck against Atletico Madrid, and was named Bundesliga Player of the Month for the first time.\n" + "\n" + "A place in the 2018/19 Bundesliga Team of the Season was inevitable after a record-breaking campaign from the teenager, in which he scored 12 goals and assisted a further 14. Such proficiency in attack catapulted his reputation skywards and he delivered once again in 2019/20, as he was named in the Team of the Season for a second consecutive year after posting a stunning 17 goals and 17 assists in 32 league games. A hat-trick – his first in senior football – against SC Paderborn in May 2020 was made more notable by the celebration for his first goal, in which Sancho revealed a T-shirt reading 'Justice for George Floyd'. The gesture demonstrated the young man's desire to use football as a driver for social change, something he has continued to do. A previous project saw him help build a new football pitch in his old neighbourhood in south London.\n" + "\n" + "On 13 May 2021, the Englishman wrapped up his career in Germany in the perfect fashion when he scored a double against RB Leipzig to help Borussia Dortmund win the DFB-Pokal [the German Cup]. He scored 50 goals and made 64 assists in 137 games for Dortmund and that incredible record meant it was no surprise United wanted to sign him. A fee agreement was announced on 1 July 2021, while Sancho was representing England at Euro 2020, with the transfer being formally completed three weeks later.\n" + "\n" + "“Football is about expressing yourself,” Sancho has explained in the past. He's a player who plays for fun and to excite, without fear and with a burning desire to beat his man.\n" + "\n" + "Jadon's debut season at Old Trafford was mixed, with the winger remaining patient before being handed his first United start, in our 1-0 away win at Wolves on 29 August 2021. Sancho scored his first goal for the Reds in a 1-1 away draw with Chelsea at the end of November, but he didn't score again until February.\n" + "\n" + "However, Jadon's output increased and we then saw his true ability, with the winger recording two goals and three assists across a six-match period. The winger missed the latter stages of the season due to tonsillitis, but finished his debut campaign with the Reds having racked up 38 appearances in all competitions, with five goals and three assists, and the promise of much more to come.",
